# BrewPi Scripts Remix
*[@LBussy](https://github.com/lbussy)'s fork of the original [brewpi-script](https://github.com/BrewPi/brewpi-script)*

This is the repository for the BrewPi Python script. The python script logs the data, monitors the temperature profile and communicates with the BrewPi slave and the web server. This fork is intended for the fans of the *original* BrewPi (called "Legacy" in BrewPi circles).  For [BrewPi Spark 3](https://www.brewpi.com/) please continue to use and support [the original project](https://github.com/BrewPi).

## Getting Started
If you are new to BrewPi, head to the [BrewPi Tools Remix](https://github.com/lbussy/brewpi-tools-rmx) repository to get started.
