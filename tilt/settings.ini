; Record values over a period in order to average/median the numbers. This is

; Use a median filter over the average period. The window will be applied
; multiple times. Generally the brewometer generates about 1.3 values every
; second. So for 300 seconds, you will end up with a set of 360-380 values.
; Setting the window to < 360, will then give you a moving average like
; function. Setting the window to >380 will disable this and use a median
; filter across the whole set. This means that changes in temp/gravity will
; take ~2.5 mins to be observed.
MedianWindowVals: 10000
